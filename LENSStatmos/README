This README file is both in the github code repository and also repeated in the Dropbox archive. In the github directory the R datasets are _not_ included because of their size. However, the R source and other parts are included to show how the data sets are created from the raw model output, netcdf files.


Summary: 
NCAR Large Ensemble (LENS) 10 members,  2006 - 2080 monthly means over the North American region.
resolution is approximately 1 degree. Variables are surface temperature, rainfall, solar insolation, and surface wind speed.

See

http://www.cesm.ucar.edu/projects/community-projects/LENS/data-sets.html



To be specific about what has been used here, all the netcdf files downloaded for this work have the prefix:

b.e11.BRCP85C5CNBDRD.f09_g16.030.cam.h0

E.g first member of surface temperature has the name 
b.e11.BRCP85C5CNBDRD.f09_g16.001.cam.h0.TS.200601-208012.nc
And is about 109Mb in size. 


To use a data set in R

load("LENSStatmosPRECL.rda")
This will be a single list with the field comonent being a four dimensional array:
 ( lon, lat, time, ensemble member )
